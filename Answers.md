1. What does it mean to think in react?

1. Describe state.

In the React sense, “state” is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change. Each component can maintain its own state, which lives in an object called this.

1. Describe props.

In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component. The state can be initialized by props. and any other method in this class can reference the props using this.
